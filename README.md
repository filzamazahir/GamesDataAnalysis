## Results
The platforms with a positive trend that are most likely to be profitable are PS4 and XBox One. Most platforms tend to have a lifespan of around 5 to 6 years, and PS4 and XBox One are newer with an aggressive positive trend and life left on their platforms. PS4 games already have the average highest total sales. The genres that are the most profitable are Action, Shooter and Sports. However, there should be a focus on Role-Playing genre in the Japanese market as these don't do well in the North American and European market but gross highly in the Japanese region.
